By now you have noticed this site has a weird color scheme, its dark but its not google apps dark nor samsung pitch black dark, its just dARK, well this is where i introduce this theme officially.<br>
#### Introduction:

> This is my own effort to create a color scheme that doesn't blind me by being too dark or too light and not solarized (ex favorite ).
<br> i found this color (`0f111a`) for the first time on material theme for vscode, so i copied the main color and added other colors gradually with time until here we are

<br><strong>currently anything that uses Xresources can use these colors, and there are many other apps themed as well.</strong>
